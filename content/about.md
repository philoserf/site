_We are all human beings, being human._

## Who I Am

I think deeply, learn constantly, make unexpected connections, and articulate complex ideas while maintaining confidence in a strategic vision.

A former US Army paratrooper and Ranger, I've navigated corporate landscapes and startup terrains, specializing in learning how to do the next thing we must do.

## Philosophy

> Assume good intentions.  
> Only ask for permission once.  
> Simplicity is hard but mandatory.  
> Use one file until you need another.  
> Use one folder until you need another.  
> Name things once.  
> Submit to defaults until you have a strong reason.  
> Yes, and...  

## Background

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the Univerity at Albany, State University of New York. My educational journey continues daily through various challenges, engaging conversations, and the relentless pursuit of acquiring new skills.

## Beyond Work

When not solving complex problems, you might find me:

- Traversing backcountry trails with everything I need on my back.
- Exploring far-flung corners of the world.
- Crafting perfect balance in a cocktail glass.
- Finding rhythm and meaning in spoken and written word.
