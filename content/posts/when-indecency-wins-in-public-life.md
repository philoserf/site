Indecency in public life is not new. What stings is watching it win.

Public figures lie without consequence. Cruelty becomes entertainment. Corruption goes unpunished. Vulgarity crowds out civility. The triumph matters most. Indecency does not just appear; it wins, gains power, draws followers, reshapes norms. What once ended careers now launches them. What once brought shame now draws applause.

This delivers three pains at once: the violation itself, its public nature forcing everyone to witness it, and its success proving that the structures meant to stop it have failed. The result is moral vertigo. If indecency triumphs, what does that say about our society? About the fellow citizens who reward it? About the institutions that permit it?

The observer role corrodes. Watching without acting breeds a sense of complicity, yet acting too soon risks becoming what you oppose. The exhaustion is deliberate. Flood the zone with enough shamelessness and people stop noticing, stop expecting better, stop believing better is possible. Outrage becomes performance because no one can sustain genuine outrage at industrial scale.

History confirms the pattern. Republics have fallen when citizens chose strong leaders over decent ones, when spectacle replaced competence, when the look of strength mattered more than the thing itself. The sequence repeats: normalize transgression, attack accountability, redefine virtue as weakness, celebrate dominance over service.

The question is not whether indecency sometimes wins—it always has—but whether its triumph becomes permanent through silence or exhaustion. Document what happens, for future accountability. Build alternative institutions. Guard your local sphere of decency. The power of naming this pattern lies in the specific demoralization it describes: the moment before we choose capitulation or resistance. That triumph is contextual and temporary—unless we decide otherwise.
