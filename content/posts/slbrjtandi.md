We had a frost yesterday morning and morning rain today. The birds sing and caw, busying themselves with the work they must do. Our gardens and all of nature awaken around us.

Welcome to the midpoint between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice.[^1] May Day, Beltane, Late Spring.

First light this morning was 05:25 and sunrise was 06:33. The sun will set here at 20:45 and last light will be 21:53.

We might call this moment Day-Breaking, as we now see daylight becoming dominant after the long nights of winter and warmth returning after the still cold days of early spring. We can call the moment Day-Bursting, since it has a lovely shape in Old Irish, _Lábrioscadh_. Or, in a nod to my forebears, Sun-Breaking, _Sólbrjótandi_ in Old Norse.

[^1]: The precise cross-quarter moment will be 07:52 on May 5.
