We had a frost yesterday morning, rains today, the birds sing and caw and busy themselves with the work they must. Our gardens and all nature awaken.

Welcome to the midpoint between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice. May Day, Beltane, Late Spring.

Mean sunrise where I live is now 5:43 a.m.

We might call this moment Day-Breaking as we now see daylight becoming dominant after the long nights of winter. Or Day-Bursting since it has a lovely shape in Old Irish, _Lábrioscadh_. Or, in a nod to my forebears, Sun-Breaking, _Sólbrjótandi_ in Old Norse.
