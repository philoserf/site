We had a frost yesterday morning and rain this morning. The birds sing and caw, busying themselves with the work they must do. Our gardens and all of nature awaken around us.

Welcome to the midpoint between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice.[^1] **May Day**, **Beltane**, **Late Spring**.

First light this morning was 05:25, and sunrise was 06:33. The sun will set at 20:45, with last light at 21:53.

We might call this moment **Day-Breaking**, as we now see daylight becoming dominant after the long nights of winter and warmth returning after the still cold days of early spring. We can call the moment **Day-Bursting**, since it has a lovely shape in Old Irish, _Lábrioscadh_. Or, in a nod to my forebears, **Sun-Breaking** (_Sólbrjótandi_) in Old Norse.

[^1]: The precise cross-quarter moment occurs at 07:52 local time on May 5.
