We had a frost yesterday morning and rain today. The birds sing and caw, busying themselves with the work they must do. Our gardens and all of nature awaken.

Welcome to the midpoint between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice. May Day, Beltane, Late Spring.

The mean sunrise where I live is now 5:43 a.m.

We might call this moment Day-Breaking, as we now see daylight becoming dominant after the long nights of winter. Or Day-Bursting since it has a lovely shape in Old Irish, _Lábrioscadh_. Or, in a nod to my forebears, Sun-Breaking, _Sólbrjótandi_ in Old Norse.
