My critical foci for a happy, healthy, productive life are these: sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share.

- Keep track of your meals and snacks daily in a food diary. This will help you stay on track with your nutrition goals and identify areas for improvement.
- Focus on eating nutrient-dense foods. Try to add as many fresh fruits and vegetables as possible. Also, include lean proteins, nuts, and whole grains.
