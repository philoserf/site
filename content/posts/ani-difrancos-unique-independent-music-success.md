Ani DiFranco pulled off something almost nobody else has: full independence with real national reach. Most artists either stay fiercely autonomous and small, or they get famous by giving up pieces of that independence. She didn't. She founded Righteous Babe Records in 1990 at age 19,[^1] kept her masters, set her own pace, toured constantly, and still landed in college radio, mainstream press, and multiple cultural circles without bending toward any of them.

Compare her to similar artists and the difference becomes obvious. Fugazi matched her ethics exactly—rights control, price discipline (famously maintaining $5 shows),[^2] no corporate infrastructure—but they kept their world deliberately small. Their influence runs deep, not wide. Tech N9ne built an independent operation as sophisticated and profitable as anyone's through Strange Music,[^3] but his impact stays inside hip-hop. Alternative Tentacles (founded by Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra in 1979)[^4] created a complete political and artistic ecosystem, but it never broke out of punk. King Gizzard, Aesop Rock, and the broader Rhymesayers world show the same sustained autonomy and serious craft, but their audiences stay within their scenes.

DiFranco cut across all those boundaries. She reached listeners far beyond folk, punk, or activism, and she did it while keeping control of everything. Other artists match her on principles, or reach, or staying power. Almost none have all three at once.
