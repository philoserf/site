title: "Bags of Water: Biology as Existential Confrontation"
description: An exploration of the phrase 'bags within bags within bags of mostly water' as both biological description and philosophical insight, examining how this materially accurate characterization of human beings reconciles our physical substrate with our complexity and challenges transcendent self-conceptions.

"We are complex homeostatic systems, bags within bags within bags of mostly water" collapses the distance between biological fact and existential confrontation in a single breath. It is precise and deflationary at once, a statement that honors complexity while refusing to let us forget what we are made of.

The layered structure of "bags within bags within bags" maps onto biological reality. Cells are membrane-bound sacs of watery solution. Those cells compose organs sheathed in fascia and peritoneum. Those organs sit inside a body enclosed by skin. At every scale, the architecture holds: a selectively permeable boundary enclosing a regulated interior. The repetition of "bags" is not reductive. It is fractal. It captures the recursive self-similarity of living systems with an almost uncomfortable accuracy.

"Mostly water" does the heaviest philosophical lifting. Humans are roughly sixty percent water by mass, and the statement uses this fact the way a zen koan uses an ordinary object—to short-circuit abstraction and force contact with the literal. Every identity we construct, every ideology we defend, every war we wage starts as electrochemical signals moving through saline solution. The gap between how we experience ourselves and what we physically are has never been wider than it is in a technological civilization, and the phrase yanks that gap into view.

"Complex homeostatic systems" is where the dignity lives. Homeostasis is not passive equilibrium; it is active, costly defiance of entropy. A corpse reaches thermal and chemical equilibrium with its surroundings. A living body fights that equilibrium every second, holding temperature, pH, osmolarity, and glucose within narrow bands despite constant disruption. To call a human a homeostatic system is to say: you are a process, not a thing. You are a pattern that persists by rebuilding itself from raw materials passing through you.

The tension between "complex homeostatic systems" and "bags of mostly water" is where the real insight sits. One phrase elevates, the other deflates, and both are true at once. Human beings are extraordinary not because they transcend their material substrate but because of what that substrate does. Consciousness, love, mathematics, cruelty—all of it emerges from water, lipid membranes, and a handful of dissolved ions holding themselves far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

There is something quietly democratic about the formulation. Every living human, regardless of status or achievement, fits the same description. No amount of wealth or power changes the underlying architecture. Strip away narrative and you find the same nested membranes, the same aqueous chemistry, the same relentless homeostatic labor. The statement makes kings and peasants literally equivalent—not as a moral aspiration but as a material fact.

The sentence works as a kind of productive humiliation, the sort that clears space for genuine wonder. Once you stop insisting on your own transcendence, the fact that bags of water can contemplate their own composition becomes far more astonishing than any creation myth.
