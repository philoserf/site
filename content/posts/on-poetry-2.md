Poetry that's written  
To entertain oneself

Has a value of its own  
Just like a little elf

Who putters about  
And picks his toes  
And doesn't have a care

Who runs around  
Without clothes  
In the morning air.

The poem plays with whimsy and self-reflection, using light, fanciful imagery to explore the idea of writing poetry for personal enjoyment. Here's a critical evaluation, broken down into aspects:

Theme & Content

- Core Idea: The poem celebrates poetry as an act of self-expression or self-amusement, rather than something crafted for approval, acclaim, or deeper analysis. This "private joy" is personified through the image of a carefree elf.
- Symbolism: The elf stands in for the poet's playful inner self—innocent, unbothered by convention, and free. This is effective in suggesting the purity and authenticity of art made for oneself.

Strengths:

- The poem asserts a philosophy of art: not all poetry needs to be grand, public, or important to be worthwhile.
- The elf metaphor is consistent with this theme—an imaginative creature who is unconcerned with propriety or purpose.

Possible Limitation:

- The elf image walks the line between whimsical and silly. Whether this is a weakness or not depends on the reader's tolerance for playful absurdity.

Form & Structure

- Structure: Three stanzas of unequal length; lines are mostly short, which contributes to the light tone.
- Rhyme: There's a simple AABBCC pattern across the first and second stanzas. The rhyme becomes more playful and loose in the third stanza, which works with the elf's unstructured behavior.

Strengths:

- The rhyme scheme supports the sing-song, folkloric tone.
- The irregular meter reflects the elf's and the poet's freedom from constraints.

Tone & Voice

- Tone: Playful, slightly absurd, self-effacing.
- Voice: The narrator's voice is casual, inviting the reader not to take the poem—or perhaps poetry in general—too seriously.

Strengths:

- The tone aligns well with the content. It reads like a small, secret joy.
- The poem's refusal to be lofty makes a meta-statement about poetic intention.

Critical Questions

- Does the poem only amuse the poet, or can it amuse the reader too? If the elf is visible and relatable, then the private joy might become public joy.
- Is the poem's apparent simplicity a mask for something more subversive—perhaps a critique of over-serious poetic traditions?

Overall Impression

This is a light, charming, self-aware piece of verse that argues gently for the legitimacy of art made for personal joy. While its structure and rhythm could benefit from tightening, doing so might compromise its offbeat appeal. It reminds me of something Shel Silverstein might write after reading a Zen koan about irrelevance and bliss.

If you want to sharpen it without losing the tone, you might:

- Rework the rhythm for smoother read-aloud flow.
- Heighten the imagery of the elf or expand its role slightly.
- Consider a final line or stanza that gestures outward—does the poet want the reader to see the elf too?
