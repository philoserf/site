## Nordstrom's Innovation Lab

### Empathy

- Open-ended Questioning - avoid yes/no answers
- Why? Tell me more - dig beneath surface
- Deep Listening - understand before responding
- Back-to-Back Listening - one talks uninterrupted
- Emotional Response Profile - map user feelings
- Emotional Check-in - team psychological safety

### Frameworks

- Business Model Canvas - 9-block business design
- Lean Canvas - problem/solution focused variant
- Rainforest Canvas - ecosystem mapping
- Value Proposition Canvas - product/market fit
- Jobs To Be Done - motivations over demographics
- Journey Mapping - experience over time
- Personae/ProtoPersona - user archetypes
- OKRs - objectives and key results

### Prioritization

- 2x2 Grid - effort/impact matrices
- RICE - reach, impact, confidence, effort
- Pirate Metrics (AARRR) - acquisition through referral
- One Metric That Matters - focus metric
- Dot Voting - democratic selection

### Methodologies

- Agile - iterative, adaptive development
- Lean Startup - build-measure-learn cycles
- Design Thinking - empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test
- Kaizen - continuous incremental improvement
- Kanban - visualize flow, limit WIP
- Triz - 40 inventive principles
- Systematic Inventive Thinking - structured creativity
- Synectics - analogy-based solving

### Validation

- User Stories - role, feature, benefit
- Concierge MVP - manual before automation
- Wizard of Oz - fake backend, real frontend
- Smoke Test - measure demand first
- A/B Testing - compare variants
- Five Second Test - first impressions
- Usability Testing - observe struggles
- Pre-mortem - imagine failure, mitigate

### Development Practices

- Test Driven Development - test first, code second
- Pairing - two people, one keyboard
- Continuous Integration - merge frequently
- Make Work Visible - use boards
- Time Boxing - fixed duration, flexible scope
- WIP Limits - constrain concurrent work

### Rituals

- Daily Standup - yesterday, today, blockers
- Weekly Retrospectives - worked, didn't, experiments
- Show + Tell - demo to stakeholders
- Lean Coffee - agenda-less structured discussion
- Sprint Planning - commit to scope

### Facilitation

- Auditions - quick concept tests
- Stop/Start/More/Less/Continue - feedback framework
- Silent Brainstorming - write before discussing
- Affinity Mapping - group into themes
- Rose/Bud/Thorn - positive, potential, problems
- Flexible Work Spaces - reconfigure for mode

### Reading

Methodology: Lean Startup (Ries), Small Bets (Sims), Sprint (Knapp), Continuous Discovery Habits (Torres)  
Innovation: The Innovators Dilemma (Christensen), Innovators DNA (Dyer)  
Culture: Orbiting the Giant Hairball (MacKenzie), The Toyota Way (Liker)  
Practice: GameStorming (Gray), Making Work Visible (Benson)  
Personal: StrengthsFinder (Rath)

## Additions

### Anti-Patterns (what kills innovation)

- Analysis Paralysis - research without building
- Feature Factory - shipping without learning
- HiPPO Decisions - highest paid person's opinion wins
- Perfection Theater - polished decks over rough prototypes
- Sunk Cost Fallacy - continuing failed experiments
- Innovation Theater - process without outcomes
- Stakeholder Whack-a-Mole - seeking universal approval
- Solution Attachment - falling in love with first idea
- Metric Vanity - tracking numbers that don't matter
- Comfort Zone Camping - avoiding customer contact

### Remote Adaptations

Async-friendly:

- All frameworks (Miro, FigJam, Notion)
- Silent Brainstorming, Affinity Mapping, Dot Voting
- Five Second Test, Smoke Test, A/B Testing
- Lean Coffee, Retrospectives (with discipline)

Requires adaptation:

- Daily Standup - needs camera-on discipline
- Show + Tell - pre-record option reduces engagement
- Journey Mapping - harder to collaborate live
- Pairing - possible but friction, use VS Code Live Share

Avoid remote:

- Back-to-Back Listening - needs physical presence
- Flexible Work Spaces - inherently physical
- Auditions - rapport harder to build

### Modern Essentials

- Lightning Decision Jam - 90-min structured problem solving
- Assumption Mapping - risk/knowledge quadrant for experiments
- North Star Metric - long-term product success indicator
- Continuous Discovery - weekly customer contact minimum
- Dual-Track Agile - parallel discovery and delivery
- Opportunity Solution Tree - connect outcomes to solutions
- Story Mapping - visualize user flow and prioritize releases
- Impact Mapping - connect activities to business goals
- Kano Model - classify features by satisfaction impact
- Wardley Mapping - visualize value chain evolution

### When to Use What

Problem unclear: Empathy methods → JTBD → Journey Mapping  
Solution unclear: Design Thinking → Lightning Decision Jam → Assumption Mapping  
Validation needed: Smoke Test → Concierge MVP → Wizard of Oz → A/B Test  
Team forming: Emotional Check-in → StrengthsFinder → Retrospectives  
Scaling: Kanban → OKRs → North Star Metric → Continuous Discovery
