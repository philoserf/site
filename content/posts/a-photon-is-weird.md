TL;DR: In the frame of reference of a photon, the distance between point A and point B is zero, and it takes zero time for the photon to move from point A to point B. From an observer's frame of reference that is moving at a slower velocity than the photon, the distance between point A and point B is greater than zero, and the photon will take a finite amount of time to travel that distance.

In the frame of reference of a photon, the distance between point A and point B is zero because the photon is always at the point of its current location. In this frame, the photon's velocity is always c (the speed of light in a vacuum), and it takes zero time for the photon to move from point A to point B.

From an observer's frame of reference that is moving at a slower velocity than the photon, the distance between point A and point B is greater than zero, and the photon will take a finite amount of time to travel that distance. The time it takes for the photon to move from point A to point B will depend on the space between the two points and the observer's frame of reference.
