My critical foci for a happy, healthy, productive life are these: sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share.

- Set specific goals for yourself and track your progress to ensure a good workout. For example, set a goal to add five pushups daily and track your progress over the month.
- Incorporate different types of exercises into your routine. This can help to reduce boredom while providing benefits. Consider adding light weightlifting to your weekly training and some yoga for stretching.
