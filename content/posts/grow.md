My critical foci for a happy, healthy, productive life are these: sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share.

Grow: Learning, working, and productive activities when your mind is alert and nourished

- Take your time while reading, and make sure to take notes. Review your notes after you finish a book to help you retain the information.
