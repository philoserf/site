Grow: Learning, working, and productive activities when your mind is alert and nourished

## Notes

- Set a specific time for reading each day. Make sure to pick a quiet, distraction-free environment.
- Take your time while reading, and make sure to take notes. Review your notes after you finish a book to help you retain the information.
