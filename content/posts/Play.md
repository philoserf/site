My critical foci for a happy, healthy, productive life are these: sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share.

Play is a fundamental aspect of personal development, regardless of age. It's not just about having fun, but about learning, growing, and connecting with others. It's a way to explore the world and discover new things about ourselves. Play allows us to be ourselves, free from the constraints of our daily roles.
