My method of scrambling eggs involved preheating the pan, adding some butter, then cracking whole eggs directly into the pan. I then start slowly and consistently turning and moving the eggs until finished. Generally this and some salt and fresh ground pepper are enough. Occasionally the embellishments below vary the result.

Adding heavy cream to your soft-scrambled eggs enhances their richness, creaminess, and tenderness.

## Flavor

- Herbs and Spices: Add chopped fresh herbs (chives, parsley, or dill) or a pinch of paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper.
- Grated Cheese: Mix in grated Parmesan, cheddar, or goat cheese for added depth.
- Diced Veggies: Fold in sautéed mushrooms, bell peppers, or spinach.

## Texture and Contrast

- Crispy Bacon or Prosciutto: Crumble cooked bacon or prosciutto into the eggs.
- Toasted Nuts or Seeds: Sprinkle toasted almonds, walnuts, or sesame seeds on top.
- Caramelized Onions: Mix in sweet, caramelized onions.

## Other Creamy Options

- Substitute crème fraîche for heavy cream.
- Mix in a spoonful of Greek yogurt.
- Add a dollop of mascarpone.
