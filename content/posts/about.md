_We are all human beings, being human._

## Philosophy

Yes, and…  
Name things once.  
Assume good intentions.  
Only ask for permission once.  
Simplicity is hard but essential.  
Use one file until you need another.  
Use one folder until you need another.  
Submit to defaults first; customize intentionally.

Think deeply, learn continuously, reveal connections, articulate clearly—all with strategic vision.

## Who I Am

A former US Army paratrooper and Ranger. I have worked in large corporations, small startups, and middling scale-ups where I specialize in learning new skills. I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University at Albany, focusing on international economics. Since graduation, I've cultivated an autodidactic approach to knowledge, broadening my awareness across diverse fields and then delving deep where connections emerge. This systematic learning transforms daily experiences into an integrated web of applicable expertise.

## Beyond Work

When not solving complex problems, you might find me:

- Hiking backcountry trails with a backpack.
- Exploring culture and landscape around the world.
- Crafting the perfect balance of flavors in a cocktail glass.
- Finding rhythm and meaning with the spoken word.
