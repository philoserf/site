## Philosophy

Yes, and…  
Name things once.  
Assume good intentions.  
Only ask for permission once.  
Simplicity is hard but essential.  
Use one file until you need another.  
Use one folder until you need another.  
Submit to defaults first; customize intentionally.

Think deeply, learn continuously, reveal connections, articulate clearly—all with strategic vision.
