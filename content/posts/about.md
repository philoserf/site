This is where I think in public—sharing the things I had to learn the hard way, and saying what I believe needs saying—clearly, publicly, and without hedging.

We are all human beings, being human.

I keep my rules simple: say yes and build; name things once; assume good intentions; ask for permission only when it matters; keep tools and structure as small as possible; follow defaults until they fail; keep the signal sharp.

I've spent time in small towns, big cities, ancient ruins, busy shops, server rooms, and a few places in between. I've shoveled snow, served burgers, worn a uniform, led teams, survived meetings that should've been emails, and worked alongside people trying to make something better.

Years in the Army taught me how clarity and discipline can carry a team through chaos. Time in nonprofits reminded me that small groups can move mountains. Working across companies of every size showed me that good people everywhere are trying to solve hard problems with limited time.

What I carry from all of it: a sense of consequence and a habit of watching the edges.  
Thought only becomes real when you put it into words others can use.
