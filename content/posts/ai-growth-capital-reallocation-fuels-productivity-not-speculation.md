description: AI-driven capital reallocation enhances productivity, not speculative hype. Market volatility stems from pricing confusion. Unlike bubbles, investments in AI infrastructure yield tangible gains. Challenges remain in adoption, tied to regulation and trust, but addressing them promises genuine transformation.

The "AI bubble" claim gets the mechanics wrong. Companies are spending on infrastructure that produces revenue now, not betting on future possibilities.

The money goes to real products. Cloud providers, chip makers, and software companies collect it immediately. The spending isn't speculative—companies pay for compute and tools they use today.

What looks like a bubble is pricing confusion. Nobody knows what AI output should cost yet, so markets guess. That creates volatility even when the productivity gains are real. New technology always looks like hype right before adoption accelerates.

Three reasons "bubble" language sticks. Analysts compare this to the dot-com era because it's familiar, even though working AI systems deployed at scale are fundamentally different. Costs show up before productivity gains become visible—you see the GPU purchases before the efficiency improvements. And bubbles make better stories than "infrastructure spending during technology shifts."

Better questions: How much spending is wasted? Where does adoption stall—regulation, integration, trust? What would turn hype into measured productivity?
