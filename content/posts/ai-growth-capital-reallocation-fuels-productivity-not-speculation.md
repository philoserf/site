description: The AI evolution is a capital reallocation phase driving productivity, not a speculative bubble. Market volatility stems from pricing uncertainties. Unlike bubbles, investment in infrastructure leads to tangible gains, with AI adoption facing bottlenecks in regulation and trust. True transformation comes when these are addressed.

The "AI bubble" narrative misreads what's happening. This is capital reallocation during rapid productivity transformation, not speculation divorced from fundamentals.

The mechanics differ from classical bubbles. Investment in compute, data centers, and talent produces near-term, monetizable capability. Revenue lands immediately in cloud providers, semiconductors, and enterprise software. The spending isn't speculative—it's transactional.

What looks like bubble behavior is mostly pricing uncertainty. Firms can't yet price AI output accurately, so markets guess. That creates volatility around real productivity gains. The S-curve of tech adoption always looks like hype right before it bends upward.

The "bubble" language persists for three reasons. First, analysts default to dot-com comparisons because it's the closest reference point, even though deployed AI systems at scale represent different substrate. Second, costs (GPUs, energy, hiring) show up before system-level productivity gains become visible. Third, bubbles make better stories than "capital expenditure cycles during technology transitions."

Better questions than "bubble or not": What fraction of deployment is misallocated? Where does adoption bottleneck—regulation, integration, trust? What breakpoints convert hype into systemic productivity?
