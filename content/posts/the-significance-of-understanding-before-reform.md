We've been here before.

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.  
> —G.K. Chesterton

Restatement for the twenty-first century:

- Don't remove a fence until you know why it was built.
- Before tearing something down, understand why it was put up.
- Reform without understanding invites ruin.

Chesterton identified three core modernist tendencies that drive institutional destruction. Functionalism emerges from the demand "I don't see the use of this"—the belief that institutions must justify themselves through visible, practical utility or face elimination. This pairs with an optimism in progress that declares "Let us clear it away," expressing confidence that removing perceived constraints naturally leads to improvement. These tendencies are enabled by superficial understanding, where people mistake their ignorance for insight, concluding "I don't understand it, so it must be useless" and proceeding to rash action.

The nihilist corollaries pervert these modernist impulses into more systematic destruction. Anti-functionalism operates from the principle "If it has a function, it has power; if it has power, it must be destroyed." Where modernists distrust useless institutions, nihilists distrust useful ones precisely because they work—purpose implies control, and all control becomes oppression. This escalates into destruction as virtue, where "to destroy is to purify; what stands, stands in the way." While modernists clear only what seems obsolete, nihilists destroy categorically as moral hygiene. Finally, nihilists declare understanding irrelevant, asserting "There is nothing to understand—only illusions to dismantle." They view meaning itself as a mask for domination, making the pretense of understanding just another layer of deception to strip away.
