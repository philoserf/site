## Hardware

I use an iPhone 16 Pro Max, an iPad Pro (M4) with a Pencil Pro, a MacBook Air (M4), and a Mac Mini (M4 Pro). My monitor is an LG HDR Ultra-Wide Quad HD (UWQHD). Additionally, I wear an Apple Watch Series 10, use AirPods Pro 2, a Magic Mouse, Trackpad, and Keyboard with Numeric Keypad.

## Software

My terminal is Ghostty with the Fish shell. I write code in the Zed editor, primarily using the Go programming language. For knowledge management, I rely on Obsidian.
