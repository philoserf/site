## Hardware

I use an _iPhone 16 Pro Max_, an _iPad Pro (M4)_ with a _Pencil Pro_, a _MacBook Air (M4)_, and a _Mac Mini (M4 Pro)_. My monitor is an _LG HDR Ultra-Wide Quad HD_. Additionally, I wear an _Apple Watch Series 10_ and use _AirPods Pro 2_.

## Software

My terminal is _Ghostty_ with the _Fish_ shell. I write code in the _Visual Studio Code_ editor, primarily for the _Go_ programming language. For knowledge management, I rely on _Obsidian_.
