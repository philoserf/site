A bicycle for the mind once felt sufficient. You pedaled; the machine multiplied effort. Then we paved an information superhighway and rode faster, farther, with less friction. Both metaphors still describe something real. Neither describes what comes next.

AI does not amplify cognition. It predicts, corrects, and stabilizes it. Less bicycle, more co-pilot reading terrain. The system reads context, shifts gears, and keeps balance by minimizing error. The shift: from amplification to co-regulation. You no longer push force through a tool; you couple to a system that adjusts as you move.

The highway metaphor collapses too. Information no longer flows as a rider's journey but as a logistics network. Routing replaces navigation. Caching replaces memory. Fulfillment replaces arrival. What matters is not where you go but how inputs are batched, transformed, and delivered where needed. Cognition becomes orchestration.

Better metaphors emerge once we stop romanticizing the old ones.

An exoskeleton for thought extends range and endurance, not intent. Used carelessly, it weakens judgment; used with discipline, it carries intellectual loads you never could.

A personal research cell runs alongside you: generating hypotheses, recalling literature, simulating possibilities, drafting synthesis. You supply assumptions and limits. It works until you stop it.

A cognitive compiler translates vague intent into plans, code, prose. Its failures are semantic, not syntactic. Debugging means clarifying meaning, not fixing typos.

A second nervous system mixes reflex and deliberation. Autocomplete and suggestions fire fast; slower loops revise and reject. Latency matters. Trust becomes a trained skill.

Writing turns into editing what the machine drafts. Learning moves from memorization to shaping models with constraints and feedback. Expertise shows up as sharper questions, tighter bounds, faster rejection of bad output. Information and speed stop being scarce. Judgment becomes the bottleneck.
