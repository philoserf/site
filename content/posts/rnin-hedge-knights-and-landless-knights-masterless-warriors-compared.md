The medieval Japanese rōnin is a structural anomaly. In a system built on vertical loyalty, land stipends, and hereditary service, a samurai without a lord is a problem. He remains trained, armed, and visibly marked as a warrior, but he lacks the bond that makes his violence legitimate. Some rōnin drifted after a lord's death or dispossession; others lost their place; a few chose independence. Culturally they occupy an uneasy space—feared, pitied, or romanticized as figures of personal honor detached from institutional loyalty. The rōnin exists because the system is rigid enough that leaving it creates a sharp break.

The hedge knight in A Song of Ice and Fire draws on medieval European models but simplifies them. He is a knight without land, household, or lasting patronage, living off tournaments, short-term service, or escort work. Unlike the rōnin, he is not inherently disgraced. He may be poor, newly knighted, or unlucky. Westerosi society tolerates him because knighthood there is less tightly bound to land than samurai status is to stipends. The hedge knight is marginal but not subversive. He is precarious, not anomalous.

Historical Europe offers several partial matches rather than a single type. The closest is the landless or bachelor knight, a man with title and training but no estate. Such knights moved between courts, served as retainers, joined campaigns, or lived on wages and ransoms. In late medieval Italy and parts of France this role shades into the condottiero, a more organized and commercial form. Earlier still, household knights and free lances filled similar niches. None stood outside the system in the way rōnin often did. They were under-supported, not outside it.

The main contrasts turn on legitimacy, mobility, and moral framing. Rōnin lose a central moral bond, so their stories turn on shame, revenge, redemption, or critique of the order that expelled them. European landless knights lack money, not moral rupture. Their stories turn on opportunity, luck, and reputation. Martin's hedge knights inherit the European pattern but add a modern lens, focusing on personal decency under corrupt power rather than loyalty versus disorder.

Violence draws another line. A rōnin's violence is suspect unless tied to a cause, often retroactively through revenge. A hedge knight's or landless knight's violence is assumed legitimate when he fights in recognized settings—war, tournament, escort, or self-defense. The anxiety is about misconduct, not existential illegitimacy.

The overlap is real. All three are trained warriors without stable patronage, living by skill and reputation. The difference is what their societies fear. Japan fears loyalty unmoored. Medieval Europe fears poverty and excess violence. Westeros uses the figure to test individual virtue against feudal power, not to solve the structural problem of masterless men.
