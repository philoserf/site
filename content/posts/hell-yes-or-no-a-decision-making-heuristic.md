A decision-making heuristic popularized by Derek Sivers: tepid enthusiasm indicates misalignment, not compromise.

The framework eliminates middle ground—no "maybe" or "I should." When opportunities generate qualified responses ("sounds interesting, but…" or "I guess I could…"), the absence of immediate excitement signals deeper resistance stemming from authentic preferences your conscious mind hasn't acknowledged.

A friend invites you to a networking event. Your response: "I should probably go—it could be useful." That qualified answer reveals the truth: you don't want to attend.

Genuine alignment produces clarity. Hesitation indicates competing values, hidden costs, or social pressure overriding actual desire. The "hell yes" response bypasses analytical paralysis by accessing intuitive assessment—your immediate emotional reaction contains information that rational deliberation obscures or rationalizes away.

Most applicable to discretionary choices where you have genuine agency—social invitations, creative projects, career opportunities, relationship decisions. Less applicable to necessary obligations or situations where immediate enthusiasm isn't the relevant metric. Long-term skill development requires commitment through periods of non-enthusiasm.

The heuristic addresses scarcity economics of attention and time. In environments of artificial abundance—infinite entertainment, social obligations, professional opportunities—the default "yes" mentality creates diffused effort and accumulated resentment. Raising the threshold creates space for commitments that generate sustained energy rather than drain it.

The heuristic can rationalize avoidance of growth discomfort. Expanding capacity often requires accepting opportunities that generate anxiety rather than enthusiasm. The heuristic works best when you've established baseline competence and face optimization rather than development choices.

The phrase functions as behavioral enforcement—a memorable trigger to interrupt automatic acquiescence and check whether you're acting from authentic preference or social conditioning.
