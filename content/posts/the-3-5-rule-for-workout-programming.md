Dr. Andy Galpin's strength training protocol:

3–5 days per week  
3–5 exercises  
3–5 repetitions  
3–5 sets  
3–5 minutes rest between sets

The protocol uses heavy loads (typically 85%+ of one-rep max) to engage the central nervous system and recruit maximum muscle fibers. The 3-5 minute rest periods allow full CNS recovery between sets, maintaining peak performance throughout the workout.
