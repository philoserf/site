My critical foci for a happy, healthy, productive life are these: sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share.

Sleep: Sleep is the foundation for all other activities, regulates hormones, enables recovery, and enhances cognitive function

To help improve sleep consistency, try to go to bed and wake up on schedule each day. Also, limit exposure to screens close to bedtime to help your body prepare for rest.

## 10-3-2-1-0

- Ten hours before sleep, I will not drink caffeine.
- I will not eat or drink anything other than water three hours before sleep.
- Two hours before sleep, I will not work.
- One hour before sleep, I will not use screens.
- 0 is the number of times I will hit the snooze button.

## Notes

Indulge in daylight

"Daylight is key to getting good sleep," says Prof Kevin Morgan, a professor of psychology at Loughborough University. It provides vitamin D, sure, "but it also exposes us to natural light, which helps us to regulate our circadian rhythms", he adds. "Light is the strongest cue to our internal circadian rhythm," says Dr. Rebecca Robbins, Savoir's sleep scientist and expert. "Without it, our bodies and brains are less able to understand when we are meant to be tired and meant to be awake."

Blackout curtains are good.

We should also introduce proper darkness for optimal circadian rhythm regulation. "Darkness is essential for good sleep, and using blackout blinds or curtains is imperative," Robbins says. "An additional helpful feature can be using a dark eye patch." For balance, in the morning, we should "throw open the curtains or blinds to flood the room with natural light," she adds.

Ban the blue light.

Blue light, we've all heard of it, but is it problematic? Here's the definitive answer: "In a 2019 systematic review, the authors reported that just two hours of exposure to blue light in the evenings reduces the production of the sleep hormone melatonin," says Dr. Deborah Lee of Dr Fox Online Pharmacy. This means it affects how we sleep. "Experts recommend wearing anti-blue light glasses in the evenings and avoiding looking at screens two to three hours before bedtime," Lee says, adding that blue light in the daytime helps keep us awake.

Tape your mouth shut.

It sounds strange, perhaps, but taping your lips with a porous tape (found online) before sleeping "increases the oxygenation of your blood and is proven to help you sleep better," says Mr Dave Gibson of thesleepsite.co.uk. "Oxygen transfer in the lungs is more efficient from humidified air breathed in through the nose than through the mouth. It can also reduce sleep disorders such as snoring and sleep apnea," Lee says.

Use a gentle alarm clock.

Using an alarm clock will help you transition away from using your phone as a clock (and then checking all the rest of your apps while you're there). But don't just buy the first alarm clock you see. "I would advise using an alarm that starts with a softer sound and then gradually increases in loudness/intensity," says Dr Luke Pratsides of Numan. "This graduated alarm will prevent you from waking up with a startle that can be unpleasant." Similarly, "bright alarm clocks (so those with an LED display) can be stressful and hinder our ability to relax and unwind," Robins says.

Exercise is good, but …

"The idea that the more energy you expend, the more you'll sleep is completely wrong," Morgan says. "Getting enough regular physical exercise is important for sleep, but stop three hours before bedtime, as the endorphins can keep you awake," Lee says. "It can also warm up our body temperature."

Try to keep cool.

Our bodies don't sleep as well when they're warm. "Keep your bedroom cool (18ºC/65ºF is great)," Gibson says. "Your core body temperature needs to drop by about 1ºC to help you find deep sleep; if you're too warm, you might not be able to access it."

"Taking a shower or a bath before bed can also lower your body temperature, which encourages sleep," adds counselor Dr Michelle Ruth.

Time limit your naps.

"Some people, quite simply, can't nap effectively," Morgan says. "But for those who can, there are many types of nap. The two main categories are compensatory naps (catching up on sleep) and hedonistic naps (siestas, naps for fun). Either way, the sweet spot is a 30-35-minute nap (excluding the time it'll take you to sleep). No more than 40 minutes, either way. You want to enjoy the benefit of proper sleep but avoid sinking into a deep sleep, giving you sleep inertia (that weighty feeling you get)."

5-HTP is the supplement of choice

Regarding more direct supplementation, "5-HTP is a good option," Pratsides says. 5-HTP (also known as oxitriptan) is a naturally occurring amino acid. "It supports the body's natural production of melatonin, a critical hormone for regulating our natural sleep cycle known as the circadian rhythm."

Consuming chamomile works

Yep, the science on chamomile's sleep benefits is sound. "It contains the flavonoid apigenin, which is thought to bind to benzodiazepine-like receptors in the brain, inducing sleepiness," Lee says. Pratsides says it can be taken as a supplement or drunk as a tea.

As does eating Probiotics

Probiotics are suitable for many aspects of our health, but there might be another benefit you need to learn about. "Gut health specialists have suggested that how our brain and stomach work together may be very important for sleep," Lee says. Gut bacteria produce gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). "GABA is a neurotransmitter known to induce feelings of rest," Lee says. "This process may, therefore, have a direct effect on sleep. There hasn't been a lot of research just yet, however."

It would be best if you also got your zinc on.

Zinc is a mineral found in many foods, including shellfish, legumes, seeds, and whole grains. It is also "important for sleep regulation," Lee says. In a 2018 randomized controlled trial, a group of ITU nurses was given a zinc sulfate tablet or a placebo every 72 hours for one month. The zinc group fell asleep sooner and had better sleep quality than those who took the placebo.

Tryptophan is another crucial nutrient to look out for

Eat what? Don't worry; it isn't some new superfood harvested from an obscure form of algae. "Tryptophan is an amino acid that has been shown to help people fall asleep faster," Lee says. "You'll find it in milk, bananas, and oats."

You can eat yourself awake, though

Sadly, it's about what you eat, not just snacking. "Avoid eating too close to bedtime, and aim to leave a few hours between a meal and sleeping," says Morgan. "Avoid eating foods that are spicy or difficult to digest near bedtime, as it can keep you awake."

Caffeine should be limited. Here are the specifics

It may seem obvious, but we must also cover this: caffeine affects sleep. "We all have slightly different caffeine tolerance, but the evidence does show that caffeine can linger for up to nine hours," Robin says. "Therefore, avoiding caffeine in the six to nine hours before you want to fall asleep is advisable." Gibson says that "there's caffeine in chocolate and soft drinks, too", so it's good to be cautious if you think you might be especially caffeine sensitive.

If you're waking up to wee…

"Alcohol is a diuretic, so it can cause you to get up frequently during the night," Lee says. "Caffeine is a mild diuretic, so eliminating both near beds can help. Also, have less water before bed. Your body is perfectly equipped to go without water overnight – get those two liters in the day."

No more nightcaps

Yes, we've all considered a tipple to help us sleep through a rough night or flight. It turns out this isn't the best idea. "Although drinking alcohol can make you fall asleep more quickly, alcohol is broken down in the body to acetaldehyde, a stimulant that keeps you up," Lee says. "So I do not recommend using alcohol as an agent to help you sleep. For those who have become alcohol dependent, habitually drinking alcohol also leads to chronic sleep disturbance."

Use your intuition

Your body is clever; life is often better if you listen to it more. "We know when we've not slept well, just like when we're thirsty," Morgan says. "But for some, we look at clocks and see what our health apps say. It's the least predictive factor of how we sleep. Listen to your body. We've spent millions of years developing a sensitivity to the quality of our sleep. If you wake up feeling pretty good and alert, that's good quality sleep."

Keep a sleep diary.

Lee says, "Record your actions during the day, before, at, and after bedtime, and take time in the morning to write about what went well and what didn't. After a while, you may see a pattern that will help you improve." Given that it'll only take a few minutes, it's worth a try; you might even enjoy the process.

If you can't go to sleep, don't

According to Morgan, the easiest way to have a stormy night's sleep is to "think about it too much". When we apply thought to that essential biological activity, we're "more likely to just irritate ourselves, which increases stress, which makes us less sleepy." If you find yourself tossing and turning, just get out of bed. "Do something like reading in relatively soft lighting until you're tired again," Morgan says. Gibson adds that we can "allow 20 minutes to nod off. If you can't sleep, get out of bed, have a warm drink, or read a book, then return to bed when tired. This means your brain associates your bed with getting to sleep, rather than lying awake."

Stop aiming for eight hours.

Eight hours is a myth. "We have to sleep at nighttime; we have no choice about that," Morgan says. "But sleep does not need to be fixed in a bi-phasic routine, where you have a block of sleep and awakeness." So, sleeping for a prolonged period isn't necessarily best. We can break it up into smaller sections and do just fine. "That long sleep period is a consequence of the industrial revolution. Also, poor sleep quality has nothing to do with quantity."

Wake up at the same time daily.

Our circadian rhythm regulates when we're tired and when we're alert. Morgan says it is "generally anchored on your rising time, not when you go to sleep. So if you're going to vary when you sleep, try and vary the time you get into bed, not the time you get out of bed."

Meditation works

Getting Zen is a pretty obvious way to sleep better, and the practice works. "A 2018 review, which included 18 trials and 1,654 people, concluded there was moderate evidence that mindful meditation improved sleep quality," Lee says. "At five to 12 months of follow-up, mindfulness meditation was as good as other evidence-based sleep treatments at inducing sleep and improving sleep quality. Also, meditating for 10–30 minutes a day has been shown to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety and improve sleep."

Jot down those worries.

If you find your mind racing as you're trying to nod off, writing down those thoughts might help. "Ensure important tasks or thoughts have been noted so that they don't stop you from winding down your mind and getting into a relaxed state," Ruth says. "Some people find keeping a notepad by their bed helpful to note any important thoughts that come to mind in the middle of the night." Plus, "critical thought" isn't forgotten, which might help you sleep easily.

Avoid stressful information first thing in the morning.

Morning paper person? "We tend to feel more stressed and anxious in the morning due to a surge of cortisol within the first hour of waking," Ruth says. "While it's tempting to reach for your phone first thing in the morning, it is better for your anxiety to consume news and other potentially stressful things once your cortisol has had a chance to decrease. Avoid it just before you go to sleep, too, as it'll give you a surge of cortisol, keeping you awake." So stick to the back pages.

Associate your room with sleeping.

This one is a bit like a dog with its bed. "Most people who sleep well have completely accidentally taught themselves that their bed and its position and its smell are where they fall asleep," Morgan says. By contrast, if you work from bed, you might associate it with the boss breathing down your neck for a report. Not peaceful.

A clean room makes for a pure mind.

Ever felt that, despite the lights being out, you can feel your room's messy energy? "Research shows that decluttering your bedroom promotes good sleep," Ruth says. "It is thought that a cluttered room clutters your mind, whether you realize it or not." This means leaving the room looking good before you wind down is good.

Fresh bedding is also a winner.

We know this feels good. But clinically, "93 percent of respondents to a survey say they sleep best in freshly washed bedding," says Ms. Farah Arshad, bedding expert for DUSK, a luxury bedding company. So wash it. This includes the duvet and the pillows. To do this, "follow the care label," Arshad says. "Use the correct heat, size, and washing machine settings; avoid overloading your washing machine; use pillow protectors to extend the life of your pillows and keep them cleaner for longer; allow your pillows and duvet to air outside regularly and shake to get rid of any dust."

Invest in new bedding (and maybe even a new bed)

Have you never replaced your pillow? It may be time to do that. "If it's stained or discolored, you wake up with aches – particularly in your neck and shoulders, you've started to get tension headaches, it's lumpy, or doesn't spring back, you might want to look into replacing it," Arshad says. Robins adds that, "if you find that your bed causes you pain or causes you to wake up in a sweat, it may be time for a new bed."

Neutral decor is ideal for sleep.

Similar to the clean room, clean mind idea. "Neutral colors are more soothing than bright colors and are ideal for the bedroom to help soothe us as soon as we walk in," Robins says. By contrast, a big red wall might make us feel alert, which isn't ideal for sleep.

Get the lavender out.

Yes, those herbal remedy folk are onto something. "Lavender is known to help reduce anxiety symptoms and produce feelings of calmness," Lee says. "It even helps relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression and has soothing properties. Crucially, lavender has been shown to improve sleep in various small studies."

Mood lighting is your friend.

It's sexier. But also "bright lights impact on melatonin production, which is the hormone that facilitates sleep," Ruth says. "Try using a sunrise alarm clock or a dimmer switch/lamp so that the light you use is more calming."

Humidify your life

While this might seem incredibly extra (especially in the UK, where MR PORTER is based), Lee says that "keeping the air in your bedroom well humidified (the optimum is 40 to 60 percent humidity) can help keep your nasal passageways, mouth, and airways, stay hydrated, which can aid nighttime breathing." So consider it; you're worth it.
