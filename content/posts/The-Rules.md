# The Rules

## Keep it simple or Make it when you need it

- If it has a name, do not give it another name.
- Once you give it a name, do not give it another name.
- Start with one file until you need another file.
- Split content to a new file when scope warrants a new file.
- Start with one folder until you need a subfolder.
- Create a subfolder when you need a subfolder.

## Surrender or Have a reason

- Adapt to the default configuration.
- After a sincere effort to adapt fails, modify the default configuration.
- Review your configurations for cruft from time to time.

## Todo

- [ ] Add _why_ & provide examples
- [ ] Add more rules by others that align with these principles
- [ ] Add section on when to break these rules
- [ ] Include real-world case studies
