Brann Dace grew up on a quiet Imperial frontier world where success meant university placement and corporate service. He wanted that path—steady work, predictable life, civilized gravity wells—but he failed the entrance examinations. It wasn't dramatic; a simple letter, polite phrasing, and the sudden collapse of a future he'd rehearsed.

With no prospects planetside, he joined the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service as a courier. The Scouts valued restless minds and independent habits, and Dace had both. They assigned him to a Type-S Scout/Courier: cramped, finicky, always one inspection away from grounding. He learned to patch thermal conduit with scrap plating, tune drive harmonics by ear, and smile through diplomatic briefings he only half understood. One early assignment had him deliver a sealed Imperial message through a volatile corridor—nothing flashy, but the tension on the docks when he arrived told him it mattered. His calm demeanor earned him his first and only promotion, along with formal vacuum-suit certification.

Life pulled at him from afar when someone close died. The memorial rituals, the awkward silences from relatives, the realization that his planet kept spinning without him—it all pushed him back to the stars. The ship felt more like home than the gravity of his birthworld ever had.

In his third term, a routine courier stop went wrong. A minor polity misread an Imperial communiqué and condemned it as interference. Shots were fired. Trade froze. Brann carried the diplomatic stain—and a local official swore personal vengeance. The affair never blossomed into war, but it marked him. Tired, wary, he mustered out with a mustering-out benefit few would turn down: the transfer of his aging Type-S under long-term Scout Service obligations. It was never fully his; the Imperium could recall it, inspect it, or assign it. But for a time, the ship kept him fed.

Quiet, lonely runs carried him from world to world. He worked data couriers, small-contract mail routes, and odd jobs. The ship's hull hours climbed and the strain on his body grew. When a depot inspector quietly recommended layup before the next structural failure, Dace complied. He placed the Type-S in long-term storage at a reserve station on the edge of the subsector, paying minimum maintenance fees. Officially mothballed. Unofficially his ace-in-the-hole.

His Scout clearance and technical bent drew attention from an Intelligence branch. They recruited him for covert observation work. The training sharpened his social instincts, taught him to lie politely, and drilled him in quiet observation. Then, on assignment, he learned something he should not have. It was less the content than the implication—the wrong people knew he knew. Contracts dissolved. He moved safehouse to safehouse. The term ended abruptly, leaving him with an Enemy more dangerous than his old rival.

Attempting to vanish behind forged identities, he applied for work in the Rogue profession and failed. Bureaucracy swept him into an interstellar law-enforcement bureau instead. Ironically, he was good at it. He maintained public calm, wrangled documentation, and quietly brokered cease-fires between customs and captains. He built a network of informants and reliable port contacts—men and women who could grease berthing, expedite manifests, or quietly lose a file. But age crept into his joints, and he resigned before his physical lag endangered colleagues.

The turning point came aboard a merchant line. His administrative discipline and diplomatic calm smoothed cargo flow. When one high-risk run delivered perfectly—tight timing, ravenous market, favorable tariffs—he received a windfall. Combined with his Merchant benefit, it allowed him to acquire a Free Trader. Not new. Not glamorous. But profitable—something the Scout ship had never been.

The Free Trader became his public face: a legitimate hull, a dull registry number, a thousand kilos of cargo capacity. He moved freight between marginal worlds, negotiated berthing fees, and kept customs inspectors politely confused. For a few years, he even experienced the high life—good meals, better drink, and travel without fear.

Behind all of it, the Type-S slept in reserve storage, its IISS serial number dormant in Imperial systems. Brann kept paying the fees. Sometimes he sent a software patch. Sometimes he checked the environmental log. He never explained to crew why he smiled faintly when someone mentioned the Scouts.

Today, at forty-six, aches tug at his joints and his reflexes are slower. But Dace is alive, solvent, and mobile. He keeps a trader's ledger, a scout's caution, and an agent's secrets. His enemies have trouble tracking a man who blends into traffic lanes, but if cornered, he can vanish back into that reserve station and take the Type-S into the dark for one last jump.

No one asks why he maintains two ships. Most assume sentimentality. They're half right.

### Physical Presence & Temperament

Brann Dace moves deliberately, conserving energy the way a veteran spacer conserves oxygen. His frame is lean from years in low-g corridors, but the stiffness in his shoulders reveals accumulated damage. He wears practical fabrics, favors redundant seals and pockets, and avoids clothing that telegraphs affiliation. His voice is quiet, pitched for briefing rooms, corridors, and starship bridges. He listens more than he speaks, especially in conflict.

Temperamentally, Dace dislikes spectacle. He is patient, suspicious, and unfailingly polite until diplomacy fails. The only time his façade cracks is when someone suggests the Imperium doesn't keep secrets—it triggers a flicker of old fear.

### Adventure Hooks (Ship-Tied)

#### The Free Trader

A lucrative cargo contract is tangled in a customs dispute; his old law-enforcement contacts want leverage.  
A rival trader accuses Dace of tariff fraud. Clearing his name means revealing old Intelligence ties.

#### The Type-S Scout/Courier

Imperial recall order: the depot wants it reactivated for a courier route near hostile space.  
Someone tries to pull maintenance records—someone hunting. The wake leads toward his Intelligence Enemy.

Both ships represent choices: safety in plain sight, or speed in the shadows.
