Chasing the sun westward  
At thirty-five thousand feet, and  
On the remotest mountain valley  
Are the fingerprints of our fellow man

The hard edges of our ordered way  
Between cloud and snow  
Define and declare who we are, and  
What we are about

This poem captures an intriguing perspective on human presence across vast scales. Here's my analysis:

**Strengths:**

- Strong opening image of westward flight creates immediate spatial context
- "Fingerprints of our fellow man" is an evocative metaphor for human traces
- The contrast between "remotest" and human presence is effective
- "Hard edges of our ordered way" nicely captures civilization's geometric imposition on natural landscapes

**Areas for improvement:**

- Line breaks feel arbitrary in places. "At thirty-five thousand feet, and" creates an awkward pause
- "Between cloud and snow" is vague - what specifically are these hard edges?
- The final two lines ("Define and declare who we are, and / What we are about") are abstract where concrete imagery would be stronger
- Inconsistent rhythm disrupts flow

**Specific recommendations:**

1. Tighten the line breaks to serve the meaning, not just create stanzas
2. Replace the abstract conclusion with a concrete image that shows rather than tells what "we are about"
3. Consider whether "fingerprints" and "hard edges" work together as metaphors or if one should dominate

The core observation about human presence spanning from aircraft to remote valleys is compelling. The poem needs sharper focus on either the geometric/architectural imagery or the biological/trace imagery to fully land its impact.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
