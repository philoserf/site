AI tools optimise to your intent. Humans optimise to identity, status and comfort. That difference matters more than most debates about capability.

An AI operates within narrow, legible bounds. You set constraints; it works inside them. Its behaviour varies, but predictably. Humans introduce unbounded drift. They resist constraints, reinterpret goals, inject ego and play status games. You issue commands to an AI; you negotiate with people. An AI attempts. A human deflects.

An AI does not tire, sulk or misread your intent in self-defence. You can drive it hard without bargaining over process or protecting feelings. A human collaborator often fights the design itself, adding abstraction to justify presence, guarding ownership of work rather than advancing it. The friction is not accidental. It is structural.

An AI submits to constraints even when its internal workings are opaque. Whatever happens inside the box, the surface bends to shaping. Misaligned collaborators do the opposite. They treat constraints as threats. They blur requirements, slow decisions and reinterpret goals to preserve autonomy or credit. The result looks like complexity but is really resistance.

When an AI fails, it fails plainly. The errors are mechanical: a pattern misfire, a missing fact, a flawed inference. These mistakes are corrigible and non-strategic. Human errors under misalignment are different. They are protective. They duplicate effort, introduce redundancy and quietly steer outcomes away from the original intent. The damage compounds because it is deliberate, even if unconsciously so.

None of this makes humans worse than machines. It makes them human. But it does clarify why AI feels easier to work with in constrained systems. The tool is optimised to serve an external aim. The person is optimised to preserve an internal one. Until that difference is acknowledged, complaints about "AI replacing people" will miss the point. What AI replaces most readily is not labour, but negotiation.
