1. Mix 14ml of an ingredient with 1L of water
2. Sip the water and consider the qualities of the ingredient
3. Take notes on your experience
4. Repeat the process

I try this with bases, bitters, liquors, juices, and syrups. Diluting each with water and tasting them over time helps to understand each ingredient. I tried various ratios, 7ml of this and 45ml of that. The best experience came from a 14ml per liter ratio, except for hot-spicy ingredients like Scrappy's glorious Fire Tincture.
