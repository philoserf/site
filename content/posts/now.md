Currently based in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan, I contribute improvements to open-source projects whenever I spot opportunities. Each day follows my core rhythm: sleep deliberately, move functionally, eat nutritiously, grow intellectually, play joyfully, and share generously. Currently exploring a broad range of interests with depth where appropriate—letting curiosity lead rather than ambition. I am grateful for the gift of insatiable curiosity.

My current pastimes include:

- Building strength and stamina toward future health-span
- Crafting winter-themed toddies and hot-buttered rums

I am reading:

- _Grognard_ by Loren Wiseman (2017)
- _Outlive_ by Peter Attia (2023)
- _Meru_ by SB Divya (2025)
- _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter M Miller Jr (1959)

I am looking forward to:

- A Caribbean cruise (soon)
- A snowy, cold, and dark winter season
- The total solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, as seen from Spain
- A trip to Ireland, still in the planning
