Based in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan, I help people discover Apple products and services as a sales specialist. I contribute improvements to open-source projects whenever I spot opportunities. Each day follows my core rhythm: sleep deliberately, move functionally, eat nutritiously, grow intellectually, play joyfully, and share generously. Currently exploring a broad range of interests with depth where appropriate—letting curiosity lead rather than ambition. I am grateful for the gift of insatiable curiosity.

My current pastimes include:

- Building strength through deadlifts, squats, and bench press twice a week.
- Building stamina through running, rowing, and HIIT workouts thrice a week.
- Experimenting with craft cocktails, particularly perfecting Manhattan variants.

I am reading:

- _The Span of the Stars_ by Gareth Hanrahan (2019)
- _Outlive_ by Peter Attia (2023)
- _Meru_ by S.B. Divya (2025)
- _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter M Miller Jr (1959)

I am looking forward to:

- A Caribbean cruise with family in late autumn.
- The total solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, as seen from Bilbao.
- A trip to Ireland, still in the planning.
