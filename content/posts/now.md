## Where am I

At home in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan

## What am I reading

- _4:00 A.M. A Productivity Argument_ by Augusto Pinaud (2013)
- _Meru_ by S.B. Divya (2023)
- _Naked Lunch_ by William S. Burroughs (1959)

## What am I focused on

- Really developing an understanding of [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) as a [pair programming](https://youtu.be/aiXr7mEB4ms) partner.

## What I'm looking forward to

- A cold, dark winter
- I am so torn because I cannot do both of these. I will do the most important.
  - Ignite! Seattle 50 at Benaroya Hall in March
  - ~~A total solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, viewed from Spain~~
- A trip to Ireland, in planning for 2027
