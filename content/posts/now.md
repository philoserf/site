I'm focusing on deliberate sleep, functional movement, nutritious eating, steady intellectual growth, and generous sharing. Curiosity leads; ambition follows.

## What I'm focused on right now

- Building strength and stamina for long-term health-span
- Reading widely but finishing decisively
- Planning upcoming travel with intention rather than urgency

## What I'm doing

- Training for winter strength and conditioning
- Crafting seasonal toddies and hot-buttered rums
- Reading:
  - _Grognard_ — Loren Wiseman
  - _Outlive_ — Peter Attia
  - _Meru_ — SB Divya
  - _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ — Walter M. Miller Jr.

## What I'm looking forward to

- A Caribbean cruise
- A cold, dark winter
- The 2026 total solar eclipse, as seen from Spain
- A trip to Ireland, in planning next

## What I'm intentionally not doing

- Expanding commitments beyond core routines
- Optimizing tools or workflows beyond essentials
