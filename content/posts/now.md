Based in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan, I help people discover Apple products and services as a sales specialist. I contribute improvements to open-source projects whenever I spot opportunities. Each day follows my core rhythm: sleep deliberately, move functionally, eat nutritiously, grow intellectually, play joyfully, and share generously. Currently exploring a broad range of interests with depth where appropriate—letting curiosity lead rather than ambition. I am grateful for the gift of insatiable curiosity.

My current pastimes include:

- Building strength through deadlifts, squats, and bench press three times a week.
- Building stamina through running, rowing, and HIIT workouts three times a week.
- Experimenting with craft cocktails, particularly perfecting Old Fashioned variants.
- Reading actively. See [Books I Am Reading]({{< ref "books-i-am-reading" >}}).

I am looking forward to:

- a road trip to DC later this spring
- a Caribbean cruise in late autumn
- the total solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, as seen from Bilbao.
- a trip to Ireland, still in the planning
