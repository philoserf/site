Play: Recreational activities that stimulate creativity, reduce stress, and provide mental variety

## Notes

Play is a fundamental aspect of personal development, regardless of age. It's not just about having fun, but about learning, growing, and connecting with others. It's a way to explore the world and discover new things about ourselves. Play allows us to be ourselves, free from the constraints of our daily roles.
