Once upon a time in a corporate environment, this was my always-on out-of-office message:

> I do not check email frequently.
>
> On most days, I am working at a pairing station. I check my email at the beginning and/or the end of the day, which means that between Tuesday and Friday, it might be as long as 32 hours before I process my inbox and that on a Monday it may have been 80 hours since I last processed my inbox.
>
> This also means that if you change a meeting invitation on the day of the meeting, I will not be aware of that change.
>
> Please text or call me at (555) 456-7890 if you need for me to become aware of your email or meeting update.
