> Thought only becomes real when you put it into words others can use.

The statement carries real force. Let me work through it in three moves.

Embracing it: there's a pragmatist lineage running from Peirce through Wittgenstein to Brandom. A thought locked inside a single skull has no public accountability, no way to be corrected, refined, or built upon. Putting thought into shared language submits it to the discipline of logic, evidence, and consequence. Until you articulate an idea in terms others can pick up and operate with, it remains a private impression — closer to a feeling than knowledge. Science, law, engineering, and every collaborative enterprise depend on this principle. The motto "declare" points here: the final move in any serious intellectual process is making thought available for use.

Testing it: the claim gains strength when you notice how many supposedly private insights evaporate the moment someone tries to write them down. Formulation is itself thinking — it exposes contradictions, forces precision, demands structure. Vygotsky's research on inner speech supports this: even private thought is shaped by language. Mathematical proof, software architecture, strategic planning — none of these exist as finished thought until they've been put in a form others can evaluate and extend. The test case that matters most is the insight you're certain you understand until you try to explain it and discover you don't.

Challenging it: the statement overreaches in two directions. First, it conflates "real" with "communicable." A musician improvising, a martial artist reading an opponent's weight shift, a mathematician experiencing the shape of a proof before formalizing it — these involve thinking that precedes and sometimes resists language. Polanyi's tacit knowledge is the classic case here: we know more than we can tell, and that surplus isn't illusory. Second, the phrase "words others can use" smuggles in a usefulness test that's too narrow. Some thought becomes real through practice, material form, or gesture rather than language. A potter's understanding of clay exists in the hands before it exists in any sentence. And some articulated thought that nobody happens to pick up and use is still real — it's just unrecognized.

The strongest version of the claim would be something like: thought reaches full force when put in forms that invite response, correction, and extension — but it starts becoming real well before that, and the demand that others must be able to "use" it sets the bar at social utility rather than at truth or understanding, which are different (and arguably prior) standards.

The statement is a powerful heuristic for intellectual discipline. It's a poor ontology of mind.
