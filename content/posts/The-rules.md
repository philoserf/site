# The rules

Yes, and…  
Name things once.  
Assume good intentions.  
Only ask for permission once.  
Simplicity is hard but essential.  
Use one file until you need another.  
Use one folder until you need another.  
Submit to defaults until you have a strong reason not to.

## Todo

- [ ] Add _why_ & provide examples
- [ ] Add more rules by others that align with these principles
- [ ] Add section on when to break these rules
- [ ] Include real-world case studies
