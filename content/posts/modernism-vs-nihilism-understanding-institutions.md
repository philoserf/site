We've been here before.

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.  
> —G.K. Chesterton

Don't destroy what you don't understand.

Modernists mistrust useless institutions. They see a fence, declare "I don't see its purpose," and tear it down. Ignorance masquerades as insight. They assume removal advances things.

Nihilists operate differently. They distrust institutions _because_ they work. Function means power; power means control; control means oppression. They destroy everything, calling it purification. Modernists clear what seems obsolete. Nihilists clear categorically.

Understanding stops modernism. Show the fence's purpose and they reconsider. Understanding means nothing to nihilism. It rejects the premise that meaning exists outside domination.

One can be reasoned with. The other cannot.
