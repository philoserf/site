1. Mix 14ml of an ingredient with 1L of water
2. Sip it and consider the ingredient's qualities
3. Take notes
4. Repeat

I use this method with bases, bitters, liquors, juices, and syrups. Diluting each with water and tasting them over time helps understand each ingredient. I experimented with various ratios—7ml of this and 45ml of that—before settling on 14ml per liter, except for hot-spicy ingredients like Scrappy's Fire Tincture.
