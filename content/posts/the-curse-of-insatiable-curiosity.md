The story goes like this: in the garden, there was one tree we weren't supposed to touch. One bite, and we'd know too much. We bit. We knew. We fell.

Maybe the punishment wasn't just exile or mortality. Maybe it was something quieter, stickier, and more enduring: the curse of not enough. Not enough knowing. Not enough understanding. Not enough world to satisfy the mind that now seeks it. A hunger that knowledge only sharpens.

"The more we look, the more we find," says the scientist, half in wonder, half in warning. It sounds like progress. It might be pathology.

Because the world isn't offering us more. Every answer breeds two new questions. Every telescope unlocks a darker sky. The closer we get to the bottom of things, the more the bottom seems to move.

We like to think the fruit gave us knowledge. But maybe what it really gave us was awareness of ignorance. Before, we lived in a seamless world. After, we lived in a world made of seams.

And yet—we can't stop. We build our towers of Babel, code our theories of everything, probe the ancient edges of time. Not because we hope to finish, but because we were made to try. It's what the curse requires.

Maybe that tree wasn't just temptation, but also a sign: This fruit will make you human. You will never be whole again. You will want to know, and it will not end.

And we—fools, children, would-be gods—bit anyway.
