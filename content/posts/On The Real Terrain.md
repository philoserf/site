The clouds forge phantom landscapes  
As mind's eye strives to match them  
To the hidden earth below—  
Each peak and valley traced  
In vaporous invention

Then:

Light fractures cloud-walls  
And the mind's map falters  
Between snow-fields and cloud-banks  
Depth deceives the eye  
White above mistakes for white below  
And certainty dissolves in air

All merely drift and dreaming  
Here at thirty-five thousand feet  
Where earth and sky  
Trade their ancient places  
And nothing is quite what it seems  
In this realm of shifting shapes

Through breaks in cloud,  
Brief glimpses ground us—  
Then close again, leaving us  
To navigate by imagination's  
Uncertain compass, suspended  
Between what is and what we think we see
