## Measurements

- Coffee: 30g medium-coarse grind (slightly coarser than table salt)
- Water: 480g filtered water (16:1 ratio)
- Temperature: 205°F (96°C)

## Process

1. Prep: Heat water. Insert filter with folded side toward spout. Rinse filter thoroughly and dump rinse water.
2. Dose: Add 30g ground coffee, level bed, start timer.
3. Bloom: Pour 60g water (2× coffee weight) in spiral from center outward. Ensure all grounds are saturated. Let bloom 45 seconds.
4. Main pours:
   - 0:45 - Pour to 200g total, spiral from center
   - 1:30 - Pour to 340g total, spiral from center
   - 2:15 - Final pour to 480g total
5. Drawdown: Allow complete drawdown, should finish around 3:45-4:15 total.

## Adjustments

- if bitter/over-extracted: Use coarser grind
- if sour/weak: Use finer grind
- for darker roasts: Lower water temperature to 200°F (93°C)
- for lighter roasts: Use full 205°F (96°C)
