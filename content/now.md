I am based in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan, and work as a sales specialist for Apple retail. I am contributing to open source projects and communities. Each day, I strive to sleep, move, eat, grow, play, and share. I am constantly learning and exploring new things.

I am grateful for the gift of insatiable curiosity.

My current pastimes include:

- Building strength through deadlifts, squats, and bench press three times a week.
- Building stamina through running, rowing, and HIIT workouts three times a week.
- Experimenting with craft cocktails, particularly perfecting Old Fashioned variants.
- Reading actively (see <https://philoserf.com/posts/books-i-am-reading/>).

I am looking forward to:

- a road trip to DC later this spring
- a Caribbean cruise in late autumn
- the total solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, as seen from Bilbao.
- a trip to Ireland, still in the planning
