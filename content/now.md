I am …

- based in Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan
- working as a sales specialist for Apple retail
- contributing to open source projects and communities
- trying to sleep, move, eat, grow, play, & share each day
- learning everything, anything, & always
- grateful for the gift of insatiable curiosity

My current pastimes are …

- building strength through deadlift, squat, and bench press 3x weekly
- experimenting with craft cocktails (currently perfecting Old Fashioned variants, especially rye and rum variations)
- reading actively (see <https://philoserf.com/posts/books-i-am-reading/>)
- looking forward to the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao
