## Computing kit

I use an iPhone 16 Pro Max, an iPad Pro (M4) with a Pencil Pro, a MacBook Air (M4), and a Mac Mini (M4 Pro). My monitor is an LG HDR Ultra-Wide Quad HD (UWQHD). My preferred terminal is Ghostty. I use the Fish shell and Zed editor. I prefer the Go programming language and use Obsidian for knowledge management. Oh, and I wear an Apple Watch Series 10, use AirPods Pro 2, a Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and a Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad.

TODO: add key iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS apps; including the command line.
